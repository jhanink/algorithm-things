## `quicksort`

Quicksort has two steps
* Partitioning
* Sorting

`Partitioning` is the act of "sorting" data to the left and right of of a pivot point. More specifically, it rearranges data such that values on the left are "less than" the pivot value, and values on the right are "greater". This effectively defines two collections, Left, Right, containing members that are less than and greater than the pivot, respectively. The collections are not internally sorted.
